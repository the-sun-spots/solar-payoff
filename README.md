PROBLEM DOMAIN

What Would 'Solar Panels' Actually Cost Me?

This project is looking just at 'Solar Panels',
but could be expanded to be any improvement in the future.

Problem Details
Many homeowners hesitate to install solar panels due to unclear net costs.  The costs that pertain to the home owner's individual needs are not easily comparable against the costs to make the improvement, so people often don't make the improvement.
Installations of solar panels in Seattle, WA will vary greatly, $15k - $24k depending upon a multitude of factors.  To accommodate the customer's need to have a customized analysis, the analysis should be based on one of the following cost analysis:
A user provided installation estimate for their individual home's needs along with home much energy they will be able to reasonably save.
An installation cost range of $15k - $24k, per the local government info. http://www.seattle.gov/light/solarenergy/solarfaq.asp#interest
Utilizing an average installation cost of $19,500 (Avg. $15k - $24k)
A user provided appliance(s) list of what they are considering replacing. Costs will be based on those replacements specifically.
A significant portion of the benefit a homeowner can receive is made available through federal and local government tax benefits and incentive programs.  This application should include those incentives in the analysis.

User Stories
As a user, I want to see how my net electrical costs to install and utilize solar panels would compare to my current electrical costs.
As a user, I want to easily understand the cost effectiveness of installing solar panels for my individual home.  I need to see the following information:
“Up front” costs, in my area, for the installation I'm considering.
How long home improvement would take to pay for itself, including installation costs and any maintenance costs I should expect.
How much annual savings I will see once the improvement is paid for.
All maintenance expenses I will incur to keep the solar panels operating at highest efficiency.
Basic information about solar panels, FAQ, and possibly how this improvement may impact my property value.  Google Results Page.
As a user, I want to be able to see what different appliance replacements would do to my bottom line.  I want to be able to determine which appliance replacement(s) bring me the biggest net savings.
As a developer, I want this application to be flexible enough to accommodate many different types of home improvements.

NOTES

Current electricity cost credits are based on the following:
Federal Government, thru 2016 as of current legislation
30% Tax CREDIT for installation costs from a 'basis' point.  Credit applies to the 'basis' remaining after any utility or state incentives have been taken.
Seattle, WA Incentives
Sales Tax Exemptions
Installations that are less than 10kw in size are exempt from Sales Tax, taken at POS.
Installations that are greater than 10kw in size are exempt from 75% of the Sales Tax, taken at POS.
Net Metering (May Diminish): If installing a system that connects to the 'grid', all surplus electricity can be returned to the grid, and used for other homes.  The total solar energy produced, even if used by the producing homeowner, can be CREDITED to the bill of that homeowner based on a credit scale described below.  NOTE:  The state of WA utility company pays production incentives to customers who produce solar energy.  The utility company then receive a federal tax credit equal to the credits they pay out to homeowners.  This federal tax credit that the utility company receives has a CAP that will be reached in 2016, thereby eliminating the tax credits available to the utility company.  This in turn trickles down to the homeowners, and utility credits from 'net metering' will diminish.  THE STATE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO HANDLE THIS DILEMA.
CURRENT WA STATE CREDITS
36¢ / kWh for Solar Modules
15¢ / kWh for any inverter
18¢ / kWh for inverter's manufactured in WA
Current Seattle City Lights Rates:
Off-Peak Rates (1st Block):  4.66 ¢ / kWh
Peak Rates (2nd Block):  10.71¢ / kWh
BSC Charge (Daily): 15.70¢ / kWh
An average residential solar energy system costs $5 - $8 / watt of production capacity for a 3,000-watt system.  This will generate ~ 3,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, breaking down to 17¢ - 27¢ per kilowatt hour generated over a 30-year lifespan.
Seattle City Light rates, in 2011, were less than 5 cents for the first 10 kilowatt hours a day and 10 cents for subsequent use in the summertime.  What is it now, and how do Seattle residence benefit financially????
